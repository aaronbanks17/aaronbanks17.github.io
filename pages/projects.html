                        Demarcation</a>
                        <p>
                            I argue that in the social sciences, the effect of a theory becoming 
                            known by the agents it purports to describe amounts to a problem of 
                            selection- not on the data which one might test the theory against,
                            but on the process governing the generation of any possible data. Under
                            this interpretation, it becomes unclear when one should regard a 
                            social or economic theory as <span>testable</span>. I propose a 
                            criterion for classifying testable social and economic theories
                            as an extension of Karl Popper's answer to the <span> Problem of Demarcation.</span>

                            The paucity of numerical data need not result in scholars implementing

                            Using the method of <span> partial identification</span>, I give an example 
                            of how regression analysis may be implemented in the study of ancient economies, 
                            and show that this method allows scholars to explicitly demonstrate the effect 
                            on their conclusions of their assumptions regarding the representativeness 
                            of archeological evidence.

                        <span>(website coming soon)</span> A.J. Hesby and I are developing a code base for fine-tuning 
                        predictive models of Over-Under wagers. We are also working on developing a website containing full

                        models.

                    Does the Fed affect Tactit Collusion?
                        <p>
                            The basic theory of oligopolistic competition implies that a firm's decision to 
                            maintain tacit collusion is a function of the risk free rate. I study the connection
                            between a central banks influence over interest rates and the incidence of tacit 
                            collusion across an economy.

                    Partially Idenitifying the Spillover Effects of Minimum Wage Policy
                        <p>
                            The direct effect of minimum wage policy on poverty and unemployment is controversial both 
                            theoretically and empirically. I study whether minimum wage policy influences
                            the structure of wages in the immediate neighborhood of a newly establsihed wage floor. 
                            Once a new policy is established, changes in the structure around the new minimum are likely 
                            to influence the propsective earnings of workers who were working at or near this wage level. 
                            Hence, minium wage policy may have indirect effects on unemployment and poverty if it affects the 
                            wage structure locally.

                    Leveraging Uncertainty in Risk Management
                        <p>
                            Many models of risk management utilize distributional assumptions on the risk associated with 
                            porfolios. In particular, FHVaR utilizes assumptions on the stability of the distribution of 
                            returns over time. When these assumptions are relaxed, the VaR and resulting level of 
                            margin to be allocated becomes uncertain. However, the determination of margin by risk managers
                            based on an uncertain calculation of the FHVaR may actually benefit trading firms in the long run 
                            depending on the decison rule used for allocating this margin.

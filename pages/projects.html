                            Theories may be informative to agents. When agents' actions are determined by the predictions of a
                            theory, the predictions endogenize the data that they are tested against. In this case, it is unclear
                            in what manner these theories can be regarded as scientific. I characterize this problem in a general
                            framework, and state an idealized criterion for theory selection. I then informally suggest the application
                            of this framework in the analysis of various settings.

                    Does the Fed affect Tacit Collusion?
                        <p>
                            The basic theory of oligopolistic competition implies that a firm's decision to 
                            maintain tacit collusion is a function of their discount rate, which governs their sensitivity
                            to changes future payoffs (Tirole, 1988). In basic models of firm payoffs, the discount rate is 
                            determined by the risk free rate of interest. Central banks can influence this rate through monetary
                            policy. I am interested in analyzing the relationship between montetary policy and the incidence of tacit 
                            collusion across an economy. Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) analyze the changes in firms' ability 
                            to maintain collusion in the presence of "booms." Dal Bo (2007) analyzes tacit collusion under 
                            randomly fluctuating discount rates. My plan would be to sythesize these frameworks: analyze the affect on 
                            tacit collusion through flucuation of discount rates as inlfuenced by changes in demand. 
                            Empirically, I am interested in characterizing "bounds" on the linkage between monetary policy and 
                            competition in partial equilibrium.

                        Evaluation or Persuasion in Industrial Policy?
                            <p>
                                In the context of merger review, evaluating a regulator's stringency equates to retrospectively determining
                                how well its behavior aligned with what would have been  an optimal enforcement criterion. As Carlton (2009) notes,
                                determining the regulator's degree of stringency, like too lax or too strict, requires comparing the realized effects
                                of proposed mergers with the the regulator's beliefs about what they would be at the time of the proposal's review.
                                Recent retrospective evaluations of merger policy have adopted this perspective. 
                                Bhattacharya et al. (2024) argue that a modest increase in stringency would have reduced prices in US consumer packaged
                                goods. Similarly, Brot-Golderberg et al. (2024) find that antitrust enforcement is relatively lax in the US hospital
                                sector given what regulators could have known about the realized effects of mergers. In the US specifically, 
                                budgetary constraints or the biases of the judiciary may prevent regulators from committing to a certain degree of 
                                stringency across merger proposals (Baer et al. 2020). Under these constraints, and recognizing that enforcement 
                                has likely been too lax in the US within the last two decades, how can a regulator maintain an efficient level of stringency?
                                <br><br>
                                The merger review process in the United States enables regulators to extract information from firms pre-merger about their conduct 
                                and the market that they operate in. Given that post-merger enforcement can be costly, and pre-merger challenges may fail, regulators 
                                may be able to use merger reveiw to reduce the cost of enforcement ex-post by inducing firms to partially reveal their type through the information 
                                that regualtors extract. Through this revelation, the regulator can credibly signal their willingness to pursue ex-post enforcement and thus 
                                deter prospective mergers from engaging in in anti-competetive behavior.

                    Idenitifying the Spillover Effects of Minimum Wage Policy
                        <p>
                            The direct effect of minimum wage policy on poverty and unemployment is controversial both 
                            theoretically and empirically. The indirect effects may be even harder to pin down robustly, as 
                            they may especially be influenced by the idiosyncracies of particular labor markets. For example, if a worker 
                            is receiving a wage below a prospective floor, that worker will likely receive some form of 
                            increased compensation once the floor is imposed, or be dismissed. One interesting question 
                            is how workers receiving a wage above (but close) to the new minimum are affected. One might 
                            reason that these workers have similar skills to workers at the minimum, but benefitted from 
                            frictions in the labor market (or by capitalizing on networks, etc). How is the mobility of 
                            these workers affected? Does the friction shift with the newly imposed floor, or do firms 
                            attempt to condense wages to the new minimum? Are these workers less able to leverage an 
                            outside option in their wage negotiations as the distance of their wage to the minimum is 
                            decreased? Empirically, can one robustly identify a minimum 
                            threshold for wage increases that predicts a spillover effect on mobility?

                    Leveraging Uncertainty in Risk Management
                        <p>
                            Many models of risk management utilize distributional assumptions on the risk associated with 
                            porfolios. In particular, FHVaR utilizes assumptions on the stability of the distribution of 
                            returns over time. When these assumptions are relaxed, the VaR and requisite level of 
                            margin to protect against risk becomes uncertain. I would like to study whether the determination 
                            of margin using rules from the theory of decision under uncertainty may acutally benefit trading 
                            firms, and the extent of the sensitivity of market risk to these benefits. Intuitively, the distribution
                            of required margin over a time-series may not be the same across all assumed distributions of market risk.
                             What gains can be made by relaxing these assumption on market risk, and what cost does this entail for risk managers?

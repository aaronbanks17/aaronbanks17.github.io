                            Theories may be informative to agents. When agents' actions are determined by the predictions of a
                            theory, the predictions endogenize the data that they are tested against. In this case, it is unclear
                            in what manner these theories can be regarded as scientific. I characterize this problem in a general
                            framework, and state an idealized criterion for theory selection. I then informally suggest the application
                            of this framework in the analysis of various settings.

                    Does the Fed affect Tacit Collusion?
                        <p>
                            The basic theory of oligopolistic competition implies that a firm's decision to 
                            maintain tacit collusion is a function of their discount rate, which governs their sensitivity
                            to changes future payoffs. In basic models of firm payoffs, the discount rate is 
                            determined by the risk free rate of interest. Central banks can influence this rate through monetary
                            policy. I am interested in analyzing the relationship between montetary policy and the incidence of tacit 
                            collusion across an economy. Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) analyze the changes in firms' ability 
                            to maintain collusion in the presence of "booms." Dal Bo (2007) analyzes tacit collusion under 
                            randomly fluctuating discount rates. My plan would be to sythesize these frameworks: analyze the affect on 
                            tacit collusion through flucuation of discount rates as inlfuenced by changes in demand. 
                            Empirically, I am interested in characterizing "bounds" on the linkage between monetary policy and 
                            competition in partial equilibrium.

                        Evaluation or Persuasion in Industrial Policy?
                            <p>
                              Central banks are faced with the decision of acting as if they do or don't influence their 
                              intended outcomes by pertubring the expectation of a representative agent. On the other hand,
                              judges determine, case-by-case, whether their actions are likely to influence the subsequent 
                              behavior of specifc agents. I would like to explore to what extent antitrust regulators, like the 
                              DOJ or FTC, stand to gain by pursuing policy like judges rather than central banks. Proposed 
                              mergers may find a future collusive action potentially profitable. Regulators can merely evaluate 
                              the competitive effects of mergers based on a model of structure and conduct, or they can persuade 
                              these merger by recognizing their effect on firms' expected payoffs through their level of 
                              antitrust stringency. One merger may be proposed because it believes antitrust enforcement to be lax, and 
                              wants to 
                              take advantage of this. Another may be proposed because it intends to realize 
                              pro-competitve synergies. Regulators might benefit from first determining each proposed merger's type, i.e., 
                              whether it should be evaluated or persuaded, and then what level of stringency they should exercise 
                              conditional on this determination. I am 
                              interested in modelling this policy rule, and determining a tractable method by which regulators may implement 
                              it. Interesting questions I'd like to tackle pertain to the observables, outside of conventional level of 
                              concentration, reveal proposed mergers' types. How can these observables be used in a tractable way? What solution 
                              concept can be employed to ensure a regulator exercising judgement is not systematically biased?

                    Idenitifying the Spillover Effects of Minimum Wage Policy
                        <p>
                            The direct effect of minimum wage policy on poverty and unemployment is controversial both 
                            theoretically and empirically. The indirect effects may be even harder to pin down robustly, as 
                            they can result from the idiosyncracies of particular labor markets. For example, if a worker 
                            is receiving a wage below a prospective floor, that worker will likely receive some form of 
                            increased compensation once the floor is imposed, or be dismissed. One interesting question 
                            is how workers receiving a wage above (but close) to the new minimum are affected. One might 
                            reason that these workers have similar skills to workers at the minimum, but benefitted from 
                            frictions in the labor market (or by capitalizing on networks, etc). How is the mobility of 
                            these workers affected? Does the friction shift with the newly imposed floor, or do firms 
                            attempt to condense wages to the new minimum? Are these workers less able to leverage an 
                            outside option in their wage negotiations as the distance of their wage to the minimum is 
                            decreased? Empirically, can one robustly identify a minimum 
                            threshold for wage increases that predicts a spillover effect on mobility?

                    Leveraging Uncertainty in Risk Management
                        <p>
                            Many models of risk management utilize distributional assumptions on the risk associated with 
                            porfolios. In particular, FHVaR utilizes assumptions on the stability of the distribution of 
                            returns over time. When these assumptions are relaxed, the VaR and requisite level of 
                            margin to protect against risk becomes uncertain. I would like to study whether the determination 
                            of margin using rules from the theory of decision under uncertainty may acutally benefit trading 
                            firms, and the extent of the sensitivity of market risk to these benefits. Intuitively, the distribution
                            of required margin over a time-series may not be the same acorss all assumed distributions of market risk.
                             What gains can be made by relaxing these assumption on market risk, and what cost does this entail for risk managers?
